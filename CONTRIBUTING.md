### Suggesting Features

Got an idea? We'd love to hear it!

**Good feature requests include:**
1. **What** you want to add
2. **Why** it's useful
3. **How** it might work (optional)

**Things to consider:**
- Does it maintain privacy? (local-only data)
- Does it respect safety boundaries? (keeps ethical protections)
- Is it inclusive? (works for diverse users)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- A GGUF model file

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/oread.git
cd oread

# 2. Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ../inference && pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages

# 3. Set up environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp inference/.env.example inference/.env
# Edit with your settings

# 4. Run locally
./start-oread.sh
# Or start services manually in separate terminals
```

---

## Code Style

**We're not picky, but consistency helps.**

### JavaScript
- Use `const` and `let`, not `var`
- Async/await > callbacks
- Clear variable names
- Comment the "why," not the "what"

```javascript
// Good - explains intent
// Decrypt profile with user's password to verify authentication
const profile = await decryptProfile(name, password);

// Unnecessary - obvious from code
// Get the profile
const profile = getProfile(name);
```

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 (mostly)
- Type hints for public functions
- Docstrings for complex logic

```python
def build_prompt(character: dict, history: list[dict]) -> str:
    """Build LLM prompt from character profile and conversation history.
    
    Includes safety checks, emotion context, and memory retrieval.
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## Safety Requirements

**This is important. Please read carefully.**

### What You Can't Do

❌ **Remove safety features** - Age verification, consent checks, crisis detection  
❌ **Bypass protections** - No jailbreaking tools or prompt injection helpers  
❌ **Add telemetry** - No tracking, analytics, or phone-home features  
❌ **Compromise privacy** - Data stays local, no cloud uploads  

### Why This Matters

We built Oread with ethical guardrails because AI companions can affect people's wellbeing. Removing these protections violates the license and defeats the purpose of responsible development.

**If you disagree with a safety feature,** open an issue to discuss it. But don't remove it and submit a PR.

### Safety-Critical Files

Extra scrutiny for changes to:
- `inference/processors/safety/` - All safety checks
- `inference/processors/prompt_builder.py` - LLM prompting
- `backend/src/routes/profiles.js` - User data handling
- `frontend/src/settings.html` - Consent management

---

## Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Backend (if tests exist)
cd backend && npm test

# Inference (if tests exist)
cd inference && pytest
```

### Manual Testing

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] Chat works with a test character
- [ ] Settings save correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Safety checks still function
- [ ] Privacy maintained (no external calls unless opt-in)
